        "Sa\u00f1jaya said: O King, after looking over the army arranged in military formation by the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and spoke the following words.",
        "O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple the son of Drupada.",
        "Here in this army are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bh\u012bma and Arjuna: great fighters like Yuyudh\u0101na, Vir\u0101\u1e6da and Drupada.",
        "There are also great heroic, powerful fighters like Dh\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6daketu, Cekit\u0101na, K\u0101\u015bir\u0101ja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and \u015aaibya.",
        "There are the mighty Yudh\u0101manyu, the very powerful Uttamauj\u0101, the son of Subhadr\u0101 and the sons of Draupad\u012b. All these warriors are great chariot fighters.",
        "But for your information, O best of the br\u0101hma\u1e47as, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force.",
        "There are personalities like you, Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, Kar\u1e47a, K\u1e5bpa, A\u015bvatth\u0101m\u0101, Vikar\u1e47a and the son of Somadatta called Bh\u016bri\u015brav\u0101, who are always victorious in battle.",
        "There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.",
        "Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, whereas the strength of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas, carefully protected by Bh\u012bma, is limited.",
        "All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, as you stand at your respective strategic points of entrance into the phalanx of the army.",
        "Then Bh\u012b\u1e63ma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly, making a sound like the roar of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.",
        "After that, the conchshells, drums, bugles, trumpets and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.",
        "On the other side, both Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.",

        "The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious. Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.",
        "At that time Arjuna, the son of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du, seated in the chariot bearing the flag marked with Hanum\u0101n, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows. O King, after looking at the sons of Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra drawn in military array, Arjuna then spoke to Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a these words.",

        "There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his fathers-in-law and well-wishers.",
        "When the son of Kunt\u012b, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus.",

O maintainer of all living entities, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.

        "The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.",
        "This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.",

        "For one thus satisfied [in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness], the threefold miseries of material existence exist no longer; in such satisfied consciousness, one\u2019s intelligence is soon well established.",
        "One who is not connected with the Supreme [in K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness] can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?",
        "As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man\u2019s intelligence.",

        "A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego \u2013 he alone can attain real peace.",

        "As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, the learned may similarly act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path.",
        "So as not to disrupt the minds of ignorant men attached to the fruitive results of prescribed duties, a learned person should not induce them to stop work. Rather, by working in the spirit of devotion, he should engage them in all sorts of activities [for the gradual development of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a consciousness].",

        "There are principles to regulate attachment and aversion pertaining to the senses and their objects. One should not come under the control of such attachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.",
        "It is far better to discharge one\u2019s prescribed duties, even though faultily, than another\u2019s duties perfectly. Destruction in the course of performing one\u2019s own duty is better than engaging in another\u2019s duties, for to follow another\u2019s path is dangerous.",

        "O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, that determination which is unbreakable, which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice, and which thus controls the activities of the mind, life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness.",
        "But that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion, economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion, O Arjuna.",
        "And that determination which cannot go beyond dreaming, fearfulness, lamentation, moroseness and illusion \u2013 such unintelligent determination, O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, is in the mode of darkness.",
        "O best of the Bh\u0101ratas, now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys, and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress.",
        "That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness.",
        "That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion.",
        "And that happiness which is blind to self-realization, which is delusion from beginning to end and which arises from sleep, laziness and illusion is said to be of the nature of ignorance.",
        "There is no being existing, either here or among the demigods in the higher planetary systems, which is freed from these three modes born of material nature.",
        "Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, k\u1e63atriyas, vai\u015byas and \u015b\u016bdras are distinguished by the qualities born of their own natures in accordance with the material modes, O chastiser of the enemy.",
        "Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, knowledge, wisdom and religiousness \u2013 these are the natural qualities by which the br\u0101hma\u1e47as work.",
        "Heroism, power, determination, resourcefulness, courage in battle, generosity and leadership are the natural qualities of work for the k\u1e63atriyas.",
        "Farming, cow protection and business are the natural work for the vai\u015byas, and for the \u015b\u016bdras there are labor and service to others.",
        "By following his qualities of work, every man can become perfect. Now please hear from Me how this can be done.",
        "By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, a man can attain perfection through performing his own work.",
        "It is better to engage in one\u2019s own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another\u2019s occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one\u2019s nature are never affected by sinful reactions.",
        "Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kunt\u012b, even if such work is full of fault.",
        "One who is self-controlled and unattached and who disregards all material enjoyments can obtain, by practice of renunciation, the highest perfect stage of freedom from reaction.",
        "O son of Kunt\u012b, learn from Me how one who has achieved this perfection can attain to the supreme perfectional stage, Brahman, the stage of highest knowledge, by acting in the way I shall now summarize.",
        "Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little, who controls his body, mind and power of speech, who is always in trance and who is detached, free from false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and acceptance of material things, free from false proprietorship, and peaceful \u2013 such a person is certainly elevated to the position of self-realization.",
        "Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little, who controls his body, mind and power of speech, who is always in trance and who is detached, free from false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and acceptance of material things, free from false proprietorship, and peaceful \u2013 such a person is certainly elevated to the position of self-realization.",
        "Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little, who controls his body, mind and power of speech, who is always in trance and who is detached, free from false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and acceptance of material things, free from false proprietorship, and peaceful \u2013 such a person is certainly elevated to the position of self-realization.",
        "One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.",
        "One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.",
        "Though engaged in all kinds of activities, My pure devotee, under My protection, reaches the eternal and imperishable abode by My grace.",
        "In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.",
        "If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.",
        "If you do not act according to My direction and do not fight, then you will be falsely directed. By your nature, you will have to be engaged in warfare.",
        "Under illusion you are now declining to act according to My direction. But, compelled by the work born of your own nature, you will act all the same, O son of Kunt\u012b.",
        "The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone\u2019s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.",
        "O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly. By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.",
        "Thus I have explained to you knowledge still more confidential. Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish to do.",
        "Because you are My very dear friend, I am speaking to you My supreme instruction, the most confidential knowledge of all. Hear this from Me, for it is for your benefit.",
        "Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.",
        "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.",
        "This confidential knowledge may never be explained to those who are not austere, or devoted, or engaged in devotional service, nor to one who is envious of Me.",
        "For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.",
        "There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear.",
        "And I declare that he who studies this sacred conversation of ours worships Me by his intelligence.",
        "And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful reactions and attains to the auspicious planets where the pious dwell.",
        "O son of P\u1e5bth\u0101, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind? And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?",
        "Arjuna said: My dear K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have regained my memory by Your mercy. I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instructions.",
        "Sa\u00f1jaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.",
        "By the mercy of Vy\u0101sa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.",
        "O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a and Arjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.",
        "O King, as I remember the wonderful form of Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, I am struck with wonder more and more, and I rejoice again and again.",
        "Wherever there is K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion."
